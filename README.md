# Rebus Example Project

This is a project I am using to explore the Rebus service bus library.

This project uses LocalStack to simulate the AWS SQS, SNS and S3 environments hosted in a docker container.

You will need Docker (I use Docker Desktop) and perform a docker-compose up using the `docker-compose.yml` file at the root of this repo.

Have fun trying out Rebus, I know I am.
